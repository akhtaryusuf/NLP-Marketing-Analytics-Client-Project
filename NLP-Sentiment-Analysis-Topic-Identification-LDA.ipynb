That way I can quickly see which of my sent emails have been opened by the recipient (or at least one of the recipients if it is sent to multiple people) and if they have replied.

When you upload a list for a mail merge and you can see the column/row format of all the people, it would be nice if there was a little X next to each row so we didn\\'t have to export a list into Excel, scrub it, and then upload it into Yesware Mail Merge. The only other note I can think of is for bounce backs. I know your tool automatically records the bounce in Salesforce only if the bounce has the subject containing \"\"Post Master Delivery\"\" but for the emails that bounce back with the subject, \"\"Mail Delivery System Failed\"\" do not get recorded. It would be nice so users don\\'t have to go into each individual record and check off our \"\"bad email\"\" field. We already have a workflow to check that box off automatically if any activity comes in with \"\"bounce message\"\" which happens from the Post Master delivery bounce.
